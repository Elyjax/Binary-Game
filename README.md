Binary-Game
===========

The binary game allows you to learn through various levels to count in binary. What is 10110100 in decimal ? How can you write 37 in binary ? In just a quarter of an hour, you know it ! The goal is simple : you control a snake which must eat pellets to pass on the next level. The snake evolves with a logical that you must understand to pass the gates. Towards the end of the game, there just replace the pellets by one to realize that counting in binary, it is the same thing ! It does not need text. It speaks to the player who is in us. Have fun !
